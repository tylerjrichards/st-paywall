I made st-paywall so data scientists and LLM developers can create small
businesses around their Streamlit apps. Every week I see dozens of new
incredible apps built in Streamlit that are adored by users, but eventually shut
down or moved off of Streamlit as payment integration is too hard. This is my
attempt at a dead-simple API around payments, abstracting it away into a single
function (`add_auth`). Enjoy!

## Overview

This package gives you one basic function (`add_auth`) that adds subscription
functionality to your Streamlit apps. `add_auth` works with Streamlit's native
authentication system and adds a Stripe (or Buy Me A Coffee) subscription button
if users are not subscribed. If they are subscribed,
`st.session_state.user_subscribed` will be true, and you can access their email
through `st.user.email`. `st.session_state.subscriptions` will have the info
about their subscription(s), which you can use for more fine-grained control of
your app logic.

If the `required` parameter is `True`, the app will stop with `st.stop()` if the
user is not logged in and subscribed. Otherwise, you the developer will have
control over exactly how you want to paywall the apps!

### `add_auth` Parameters

The `add_auth` function accepts several parameters to customize its behavior:

- `required` (bool, default=True): If True, the app will stop if the user is not
  logged in and subscribed.
- `show_redirect_button` (bool, default=True): Whether to show the subscription
  button.
- `subscription_button_text` (str, default='Subscribe now!'): The text to
  display on the subscription button.
- `button_color` (str, default="#FD504D"): The color of the subscription button
  (CSS color value).
- `use_sidebar` (bool, default=True): If True, the subscription button appears
  in the sidebar; if False, it appears in the main section.

Example usage:

```python
from st_paywall import add_auth

# Basic usage with defaults
add_auth()

# Customized usage
add_auth(
    required=False,  # Don't stop the app for non-subscribers
    show_redirect_button=True,
    subscription_button_text="Get Premium Access!",
    button_color="#4CAF50",  # Green button
    use_sidebar=False  # Show button in main section
)
```

## Configuration

I hope you use this to create tons of value, and capture some of it with the
magic of Streamlit.

This package expects that you have a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file which you
will have to create. Inside it, you will need to add your Stripe (or Buy Me A
Coffee) API information that runs the subscription parts of the package. If you
already have all of your information for your payment provider, here is how the
package expects your secrets file to look.

```toml
testing_mode = true
payment_provider = "stripe" #bmac if using Buy Me A Coffee
stripe_api_key_test = "sk_test_..." #only needed if using Stripe
stripe_api_key = "sk_live_..." #only needed if using Stripe
stripe_link = "https://buy.stripe.com/..." #only needed if using Stripe
stripe_link_test = "https://buy.stripe.com/test_..." #only needed if using Stripe
bmac_api_key = "ey..." #only needed if using buy me a coffee
bmac_link = "https://www.buymeacoffee.com/..." #only needed if using buy me a coffee
```
