# Authentication

This package uses Streamlit's native authentication system. You'll need to configure authentication in your Streamlit app's settings in secrets.

For more information about setting up Streamlit's authentication, please refer to [Streamlit's documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/utilities/st.experimental_user).
